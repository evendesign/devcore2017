### About Accellion FTA

Accellion File Transfer Appliance (`FTA`) is a secure file transfer service which enables users to share and sync files online with AES 128/256 encryption. The Enterprise version further incorporates SSL VPN services with integration of Single Sign-on mechanisms like AD, LDAP and Kerberos.

### Vulnerability Details

In this research, the following vulnerabilities were discovered on the FTA version FTA_9_12_0 (13-Oct-2015 Release)

* Cross-Site Scripting x 3
* Pre-Auth SQL Injection leads to Remote Code Execution
* Known-Secret-Key leads to Remote Code Execution
* Local Privilege Escalation x 2

The above-mentioned vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely attack FTA servers and gain highest privileges successfully. After the attackers fully controlled the servers, they will be able to retrieve the encrypted files and user data, etc.

After reporting to CERT/CC, these vulnerabilities were assigned 4 CVEs (CVE-2016-2350, CVE-2016-2351, CVE-2016-2352, CVE-2016-2353).  


### Areas Affected

According to a public data reconnaissance, there are currently 1,217 FTA servers online around the world, most of which are located in the US, followed by Canada, Australia, UK, and Singapore.  
Determine from the domain name and SSL Certificate of these servers, FTA is widely used by governmental bodies, educational institutions, enterprises, including several well-known brands.  


### Vulnerability Analysis and Exploitation


#### Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2016-2350)

##### 1. XSS in move\_partition\_frame.html

> https://\<fta\>/courier/move_partition_frame.html
> ?f2='-prompt(document.domain);//

##### 2. XSS in getimageajax.php

> https://\<fta\>/courier/web/getimageajax.php
> ?documentname="onerror="prompt(document.domain)//

##### 3. XSS in wmInfo.html

> https://\<fta\>/courier/web/wmInfo.html
> ?msg=ssologout
> &loginurl="><svg/onload="prompt(document.domain)



#### Pre-Auth SQL Injection leads to RCE (CVE-2016-2351)

After code reviewing, a pre-authentication SQL Injection vulnerability was found in FTA. This vulnerability grants malicious users access to sensitive data and personal information on the server through SQL Injection, and launch remote code execution (RCE) by further exploiting privilege-escalating vulnerabilities.  
The key to this problem lies in the `client_properties( ... )` function called by security\_key2.api!  

```php
// ...
$password = _decrypt( $password, _generate_key( $g_app_id, $client_id, $g_username ) );
opendb();
$client_info = client_properties( $client_id )[0];
// ...
```

Among these parameters, `$g_app_id` `$g_username` `$client_id` and `$password` are controllable by the attackers. And although the function `_decrypt( ... )` handles the passwords, it does not involve in the triggering of the vulnerability.  
One thing to pay special attention is that the value of `$g_app_id` will be treated as a global variable which represents the current Application ID in use, and will be applied in `opendb( )` accordingly. The code in `opendb( )` includes the following lines:

#### Known-Secret-Key leads to Remote Code Execution

In the previous vulnerability, one requirement to execute code remotely is the existence of a write-enabled directory for injecting webshell. But in reality, chances are there is no write-enabled directory available, thus fail to execute code through SQL Injection. But there is another way to help us accomplish RCE.  

The precondition of this vulnerability is **Known-Secret-Key stored in the database**  

This is not a problem, since the database can be accessed with the SQL Injection vulnerability mentioned earlier. Also, although there are some parameter filters in the code, they can be bypassed!  

##### 2. Command Injection in "yum-client.pl"

To enable system updates through web UI, the sudoers configuration in FTA exceptionally allows the user nobody to directly execute commands with root privileges and update software with the program `yum-client.pl`.

will grant execution freely as root!  

### Backdoor

After gaining the highest privilege and carrying out server recon, we identified that several backdoors had been already planted in FTA hosts. One of them is an IRC Botnet which had been mentioned in Niara's [Accellion File Transfer Appliance Vulnerability](http://www.niara.com/docs/ta-accellion-fta-cve-2015-2857.pdf).  
Apart from that, two additional PHP Webshells of different types which had NEVER been noted in public reports were also identified. Through reviewing Apache Log, these backdoors might be placed by exploiting the CVE-2015-2857 vulnerability discovered in mid-2015.  

One of the backdoors is PHPSPY, it is found on 62 of the online hosts globally. It was placed in

> https://\<fta\>/courier/themes/templates/Redirector_Cache.php

The other is WSO, found on 9 of the online hosts globally, placed in

> https://\<fta\>/courier/themes/templates/imag.php



### Acknowledgement

The vulnerability mentioned in this Advisory was identified in early 2016 while looking for vulnerabilities in Facebook, you can refer to the article "[How I Hacked Facebook, and Found Someone's Backdoor Script](http://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/)".  
Upon discovering the FTA vulnerability in early February, I notified Facebook and Accellion and both were very responsive. Accellion responded immediately, issuing patch FTA_9_12_40 on February 12th and notifying all affected customers about the vulnerability and instructions to install the patch. Accellion has been very communicative and cooperative throughout this process.  


### Timeline
